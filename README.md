#What is this repo is for
In this github repository, I am keeping all the node.js code I am writing for learning/practicing node.js.


#How to use this repo
I used VSCode on Debian/Linux to write and test these codes on node v8.2.1 and npm v5.3.0. All you have  to do is install node.js and run these code with 'node $filename'

On Linux, you can use Ctrl+Shift+B to run the task on VSCode. To get it to work on Windows, open .vscode/tasks.json and change the 'command' field as you need.
